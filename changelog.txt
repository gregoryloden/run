V1	Initial run, Autoer, Filer, and numbers

V2	Added colorsat to Autoer
	Added run.verify function, syntax checking, extended variables, added breaking, more if clauses
	Created a README file

v3	Added not clauses
	Changed the format of printing to print, println, and printvar
	Fixed run.split function
	Added random variables
	Changed Varslist format, removed obsolete run$Varslist functions
	Changed the behavior of create, can also now hold colors
	Expanded colorat
	Changed the behavior and syntax of setargto
	Changed the behavior of set
	Added string typing
	Updated README with new info: lots of variable syntax, random numbers, timer variable, not clauses,
		colorat usage, printing format, typing, buttons
	Backwards compatibility issue: setargto commands need to have the type removed

v4	Made numbers.readint function run quicker
	Removed some Autoer functions that got replaced with Autoer.button
	Expanded pauses
	Fixed colors not getting recognized
	Allowed script recursion
	The stuff class is now used rather than putting methods in run
	Added option command with quitafter, timestamps, variance, and mousequit
	Fixed setargto for non-randoms
	Added the two remaining integer comparisons
	Added timestamps to printval
	Made it so that booleans can be assigned any of the if clauses
	Added scanning (multiple colorat searches at once), plus .scanx and .scany
	Actually put in the ability for colorats to use color variables
	Added call and jumpback for making "functions"
	Fixed the accidental removal of boolean use in clauses
	Added %= to the change operators
	Made the code run more efficiently:
		All scripts that could potentially be run are loaded at the beginning
		Lines are formatted upon loading to make commands process more quickly
		Comments are removed before starting the script
		Each line finds the command a lot quicker
	Updated README with expanded pauses, small bit about ifs and comments, option command usage for
		quitafter & timestamps & variance & mousequit, printval timestamps, change in booleans, scanning,
		call and jumpback
