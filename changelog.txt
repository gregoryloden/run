V1	Initial run, Autoer, Filer, and numbers

V2	Added colorsat to Autoer
	Added run.verify function, syntax checking, extended variables, added breaking, more if clauses
	Created a README file

v3	Added not clauses
	Changed the format of printing to print, println, and printvar
	Fixed run.split function
	Added random variables
	Changed Varslist format, removed obsolete run$Varslist functions
	Changed the behavior of create, can also now hold colors
	Expanded colorat
	Changed the behavior and syntax of setargto
	Changed the behavior of set
	Added string typing
	Updated README with new info: lots of variable syntax, random numbers, timer variable, not clauses,
		colorat usage, printing format, typing, buttons
	Backwards compatibility issue: setargto commands need to have the type removed

v4	Made numbers.readint function run quicker
	Removed some Autoer functions that got replaced with Autoer.button
	Expanded pauses
	Fixed colors not getting recognized
	Allowed script recursion
	The stuff class is now used rather than putting methods in run
	Added option command with quitafter, timestamps, variance, and mousequit
	Fixed setargto for non-randoms
	Added the two remaining integer comparisons
	Added timestamps to printval
	Made it so that booleans can be assigned any of the if clauses
	Added scanning (multiple colorat searches at once), plus .scanx and .scany
	Actually put in the ability for colorats to use color variables
	Added call and jumpback for making "functions"
	Fixed the accidental removal of boolean use in clauses
	Added %= to the change operators
	Made the code run more efficiently:
		All scripts that could potentially be run are loaded at the beginning
		Lines are formatted upon loading to make commands process more quickly
		Comments are removed before starting the script
		Each line finds the command a lot quicker
	Updated README with expanded pauses, small bit about ifs and comments, option command usage for
		quitafter & timestamps & variance & mousequit, printval timestamps, change in booleans, scanning,
		call and jumpback

v5	Added option for scanorder
	Made timestamps show 00 instead of 0
	Fixed jumps looking at nulls when label searching
	Fixed quitting giving the wrong line number
	Fixed run.commasplit function that caused setargto not to read arguments properly
	Changed verify to display all syntax errors it can find
	Allowed println to print strings just as print does, in addition to its current function
	Made jumps run quicker
	Made for loops to run quicker
	Allowed jumps within for loops to use labels outside of the loop
	Added bracket syntax for ifs
	Breaks no longer exit scripts
	Allowed printval to print all system variables
	Added !=, or, & and to the if clauses
	Added arithmetic, though change commands still remain
	Added more exclamation points!
	Updated README with option command usage for scanorder, println, if bracket syntax, break update,
		endingcall, printval abilities, if clause expansion, arithmetic expansion
	Backwards compatibility issue: breaks no longer exit scripts
	Backwards compatibility issue: optionon endingtimestamp is replaced by optionon endingcall [label]

v5.1	Added the ability to destroy created variables
	Fixed a bug that was causing boolean clauses to erase themselves
	Updated README with destroy command

v5.2	Fixed a bug that prevented if brackets and for/ends being used at the end of a script
	Fixed setargto allowing variables to be set to the wrong values
	Fixed endingcall misinterpreting commands
	Removed the ability to destroy created variables
	Updated README with removal of destroy command

v5.3	Fixed a bug where breaks wouldn't remove the for loop's variable

v6	Fixed a bug where scripts could not be run from within scripts
	Fixed a bug where break would break out of all loops
	Improved speed by preassigning variables
	Arithmetic and boolean logic combined
	Extended key pressing slightly
	Changed format for type, print, and println commands
	Added option to offset screen interactions
	Added ability to scroll
	Added timer variable, removed .timer system variable
	Removed treset command
	Updated README with large chunk about arithmetic format & clauses, extended key pressing, more info
		on if command syntax, new info on type + print + println syntax, offset option, scrolling,
		timer variables, various miscellanous small things
	Backwards compatability issue: type, print, and println commands have a new syntax
	Backwards compatibility issue: .timer no longer exists, treset no longet exists
