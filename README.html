&nbsp;Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of a Gregory Loden <i>Run</i>-class autoclicker!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;This wonderful piece of software allows you to write your own mouse-controlling programs using text files and a simple syntax, allowing for easy and quick program creation.<br>
&nbsp;To start off, there is a folder named "scripts" in the same directory as the run.class file. This is where all autoclick scripts will be located. To be recognized, all scripts should end with .txt. Two sample scripts have been provided.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On to how to use the program!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;To run a script, type <code>java run ??? ...</code> in a command-line terminal. This will run the script named <code>???</code>. The <code>...</code> is an arbitrary amount of arguments to be passed to the autoclicker for use in the script. We'll see why we need these later.<br>
&nbsp;In all commands, command calls and arguments are separated by whitespace tabs or spaces. Tabs and spaces are recognized by the program as separators.<br>
&nbsp;The program supports a variety of commands, the number of which will grow as the program does.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's begin!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>================================================================<br>
SECTION 1- Standard Autoclicking Features<br>
================================================================</h3>
&nbsp;The core of any autoclicker is the ability to perform right clicks, left clicks, mouse moving, and pausing.<br>
&nbsp;In this autoclicker, a command looks like this:
<pre><code>	left	[x]	[y]</code></pre>
&nbsp;When the autoclicker's line pointer reaches a line, the command on that line is executed.<br>
&nbsp;In this case, a left click. The name goes at the beginning, followed by the arguments. In this README file, anything, within <code>[]</code> brackets stands for something that would get replaced by actual values written by the scriptmaker. In the left click, the mouse gets moved to the x-<code>[x]</code> and y-<code>[y]</code> coordinates provided, and left clicks that spot. For example,
<pre><code>	left	100	200</code></pre>
will left-click at x-<code>100</code>, y-<code>200</code>.<br>
&nbsp;All commands take up one line only, and contain only lowercase letters. Uppercase letters are not used by any words defined by the autoclicker. You can also leave yourself comments by starting a line with <code>//</code>, or pretty much anything except one of the commands.
<pre><code>	// Right click:
	right	[x]	[y]
	
	. Move:
	move	[x]	[y]</code></pre>
&nbsp;<code>right</code> will move and perform a right click, and <code>move</code> will move the mouse without clicking. Any number of tabs and spaces can be added between arguments and commands, and the interpreter will pass right over them. That means that
<pre><code>	move	[x]	[y]</code></pre>
is the same as
<pre><code>	   move			[x] [y]</code></pre>
but not
<pre><code>	move	[x][y]</code></pre>
as whitespace is needed to separate arguments (so <code>53 4</code> is different than <code>534</code>). In commands, when writing a number, only the digits (and possibly negative sign before the digits) are taken into account, so these two commands,
<pre><code>	move	1000	234
	move	1,000	2jrgfsd3j.4</code></pre>
will perform the same action (move the mouse to x-<code>1000</code>, y-<code>234</code>).<br>
&nbsp;Some commands can have multiple forms, and can accept different amounts of arguments. <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> can be used in this form:
<pre><code>	left	[num]
	right	[num]</code></pre>
&nbsp;Rather than move and click, this will have the mouse will perform differently depending on what <code>[num]</code> is: 2 will press and release the mouse, anything less than 2 will press the mouse, and anything greater than 2 will release the mouse. Take a look at this:
<pre><code>	move	100	100
	pause	1000
	left	1
	pause	1000
	move	100	200
	pause	1000
	left	3</code></pre>
&nbsp;This would move the mouse to x-<code>100</code>, y-<code>100</code>, wait a second, press the left mouse button, wait a second, drag the mouse to x-<code>100</code>, y-<code>200</code>, wait a second, and release the button.<br>
&nbsp;In addition to moving the mouse, you can also move the mouse scroll wheel with the following commands:
<pre><code>	scroll	up
	scroll	down
	scroll	up	[number]
	scroll	down	[number]</code></pre>
&nbsp;The <code>scroll</code> command will execute one scroll "click" in the given direction, or <code>[number]</code> "clicks" if a number is provided.<br>
&nbsp;<i>Run</i> also supports pausing for certain periods of time. The command
<pre><code>	pause	[t]</code></pre>
will pause for <code>[t]</code> milliseconds. For instance,
<pre><code>	pause	1000</code></pre>
will have the autoclicker do nothing for 1 second. You can also have the <code>pause</code> command by itself:
<pre><code>	pause</code></pre>
&nbsp;This will pause until you press ENTER on the console/terminal that you ran the script from. There are 2 more types of pauses:
<pre><code>	pause	[x]	[y]	[r]	[g]	[b]</code></pre>
and
<pre><code>	pausenot	[x]	[y]	[r]	[g]	[b]</code></pre>
&nbsp;These pause until something happens to the color of the pixel at x-<code>[x]</code> and y-<code>[y]</code>. <code>pause</code> will pause until the red-green-blue color at x-<code>[x]</code>, y-<code>[y]</code> is red-<code>[r]</code>, green-<code>[g]</code>, and blue-<code>[b]</code>. <code>pausenot</code> does the opposite- it will pause WHILE the pixel is that color. The command
<pre><code>	pause	123	456	128	255	32</code></pre>
will stop the autoclicker until the pixel at x-<code>123</code>, y-<code>456</code> is the RGB color r-<code>128</code>, g-<code>255</code>, b-<code>32</code>.<br>
&nbsp;These two five-argument pauses can also take a sixth argument, combining both ways of pausing. This number, a time in milliseconds, tells the pause how long to wait before ignoring the color and resuming the program. This is useful if the color does not change in time, but the program can catch this and handle it. Whichever comes first, the pause will resume. This command,
<pre><code>	pause	123	456	255	255	255	1000</code></pre>
will wait for the pixel to change, but if a second goes by, it will stop pausing and resume anyway.<br>
&nbsp;You may come across a need to end your script early. For this purpose, moving the mouse during pauses (except for the no argument <code>pause</code>) will stop the script and end the program.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;And of course, we can't forget looping! For this, the following command is provided:
<pre><code>	jump	[LABEL]</code></pre>
&nbsp;This will move the line pointer to a label in the format
<pre><code>	:[LABEL]</code></pre>
&nbsp;For example,
<pre><code>	:Endless
	jump	Endless</code></pre>
is an infinite loop. Labels must contain no whitespace. Here's a cumulative example:
<pre><code>	:main
	right		100	200
	pause		110	210	255	255	255
	left		110	210
	pausenot	110	210	255	255	255
	move		90	190
	pause		500
	jump		main</code></pre>
&nbsp;This will right click at x-<code>100</code>, y-<code>200</code>, wait until the pixel at x-<code>110</code>, y-<code>210</code> is white (r-<code>255</code>, g-<code>255</code>, b-<code>255</code>), left click  at x-<code>110</code>, y-<code>210</code>, wait for it to stop being white, move the mouse to x-<code>90</code>, y-<code>190</code>, wait half a second, and repeat.<br>
&nbsp;<i>Run</i> will not perform any automatic looping. If the <code>jump</code> were removed, the code would end after the last pause.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;In addition to standard jumping, there is also a command to use a part of the script in multiple places at once! This is done with two similar commands. The first one,
<pre><code>	call	[label]</code></pre>
does the exact same thing that <code>jump</code> does, but it will remember where it got called. Paired with it is another command,
<pre><code>	jumpback</code></pre>
which will return to the most recent <code>call</code> command that got executed. That means that if there are multiple <code>call</code>s, <code>jumpback</code> commands will go back down the list of <code>call</code> commands in the reverse order that they were called. Here's an example:
<pre><code>	call	test
	call	test
	call	test
	jump	end
	
	:test
	left	100	100
	call	test2
	jumpback
	
	:test2
	pause	1000
	jumpback
	
	:end</code></pre>
&nbsp;This will left click at x-<code>100</code>, y-<code>100</code>, pause for a second, and repeat that twice more.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;The autoclicker can also run scripts from within a script:
<pre><code>	run	[script]	...</code></pre>
will run the script <code>[script]</code> as if you typed
<pre><code>	java run [scripts] ...</code></pre>
on the command line with the arguments <code>...</code> like a regular command-line run execution. Scripts cannot have spaces in the name.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all well and good, but what programming language of any type could possibly pretend to be complete without variables?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>================================================================<br>
SECTION 2- Programming Language Features- Variables<br>
================================================================</h3>
&nbsp;Not this one! You can define variables with this command:
<pre><code>	create	[type]	[name]	[value]</code></pre>
&nbsp;To improve what you can do with it, <i>Run</i> serves as a very simple programming language. The above command will create a variable of type <code>[type]</code> called <code>[name]</code> with starting value <code>[value]</code>. These variables will probably be of type <code>int</code> (integer), used to base clicks on other data, but there are multiple other variable types. All variables are for use only within the active script. Scripts cannot use variables from scripts they called, nor from the scripts that called them. Variables are case-sensitive.<br>
&nbsp;Here's a bunch of variable creation examples, using all of the currently available variable types:
<pre><code>	create	int	x	100
	create	boolean	Good?	true
	create	color	white	255	255	255
	create	color	brown	at	123	456
	create	timer	time	0
	create	int	y	x
	create	color	brown~2	brown</code></pre>
&nbsp;Let's go over these examples!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;In the first example, the variable <code>x</code> was created as an <code>int</code>, or a whole number. To create an integer, the only argument that must be supplied is the value to store to it.<br>
&nbsp;In the second example, <code>Good?</code> is created as a <code>boolean</code>. A boolean value simply means either a <code>true</code> or a <code>false</code>. To create a boolean, the only value that must be provided is a <code>true</code> or a <code>false</code>. Booleans serve a special purpose which will be mentioned later on.<br>
&nbsp;In the third example, <code>white</code> was created as a <code>color</code>, a type used for special commands that track colors. This is one of two ways to initiate a color, both of which take three arguments. The first way, used to create <code>white</code>, is to give the red, green, and blue values of a color, in that order.<br>
&nbsp;In the fourth example, <code>brown</code> demonstrates the second way to create a <code>color</code>: the arguments are the word <code>at</code>, followed by two more arguments- the x and y coordinates of a pixel location. The value stored to the variable is the color at that pixel.<br>
&nbsp;In the fifth example, the variable <code>time</code> was created as a <code>timer</code>. This timer's value is an integer, and increases by <code>1</code> every millisecond. To create a timer, the only value that needs to be provided is its initial value.<br>
&nbsp;In the sixth and seventh examples, variables were created using other variables as a single argument. This will create a variable with the value of the argument variable. All variable types can be made by providing another variable of the same type (<code>boolean</code>s, <code>int</code>s, and <code>timer</code>s can all accept each other as inputs, more on that later).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Your variable names can consist of any non-whitespace characters, but cannot start with a period. Be careful with your naming conventions to avoid errors in your scripts related to variable overwriting. Some names are reserved by the autoclicker.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;So now that we have variables, we can use them in other commands! Using the above variable assignments, the command
<pre><code>	left	x	y</code></pre>
would left click at x-<code>100</code>, y-<code>100</code>.<br>
&nbsp;In addition to copying variables, they can also be used as regular arguments. This command,
<pre><code>	create	color	brown	x	y	0</code></pre>
would create a color with a red value of <code>100</code>, green value of <code>100</code>, and blue value of 0.<br>
&nbsp;<code>color</code> variables are used to replace sets of 3 arguments that make up a color. Assuming the same variable assignments,
<pre><code>	pause	123	456	white</code></pre>
would pause until the pixel is white. The extra argument at the end will still function, so
<pre><code>	pause	123	456	white	1000</code></pre>
will quit out after a second. Up to now, only pauses use colors, but they are used in commands later in the README.<br>
&nbsp;Creating multiple variables with names that are used elsewhere will not cause an error, but may cause problems when running the script. Be careful when naming variables!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;In addition to creating variables, variables already created can be set to new values like this:
<pre><code>	set	[name]	[value...]</code></pre>
&nbsp;Setting variables works just like creating variables, for all types of variables, except you don't need a variable type. <code>set</code> changes the variable of name <code>[name]</code> to the value that the arguments <code>[value...]</code> produce. Variables can also technically be changed with <code>create</code>, and you can change the type of the variable by doing this, but <code>set</code> is recommended for just changing the value.<br>
&nbsp;Here is an example of <code>set</code>:
<pre><code>	set	x	200</code></pre>
&nbsp;Still assuming the same variable assignments, this would change <code>x</code>'s value to be <code>200</code>. So now,
<pre><code>	left	x	y</code></pre>
would left click at x-<code>200</code>, y-<code>100</code>. All variables are <code>int</code>s unless they have been created as something else via the <code>create</code> command. This means that
<pre><code>	set	z	100</code></pre>
would set <code>z</code> to <code>100</code> even though <code>z</code> has not been created.<br>
&nbsp;There is also a special set command for using arguments with the script:
<pre><code>	setargto	[prefix]	[name]</code></pre>
&nbsp;This works as if you called
<pre><code>	set	[name]	[value]</code></pre>
assuming that <code>[prefix][value]</code> is one argument to the program, and is a single string of characters without spaces or tabs.<br>
&nbsp;As an example, say you had a script called <code>test</code> and you typed this on the command line:
<pre><code>	java run test abc123</code></pre>
&nbsp;If you had
<pre><code>	create	int	doremi	0
	setargto	abc	doremi</code></pre>
within that script, it would end up changing <code>doremi</code> as if you called
<pre><code>	set	doremi	123</code></pre>
which sets the variable to <code>123</code>, omitting the <code>abc</code> in the argument.<br>
&nbsp;Now, since some of the variable creations take in multiple arguments, but input arguments cannot include tabs or spaces, you will have to type commas between them when typing them on the command line. This means that arguments should be typed like <code>alphaat,123,456</code> and <code>beta255,255,255</code> for the following commands:
<pre><code>	create	color	test1	0	0	0
	create	color	test2	0	0	0
	setargto	alpha	test1
	setargto	beta	test2</code></pre>
&nbsp;These will end up acting as if you had these commands instead:
<pre><code>	create	color	test1	at	123	456
	create	color	test2	255	255	255</code></pre>
&nbsp;If you call <code>setargto</code> and there was no argument that started with <code>[prefix]</code>, the command will do nothing.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what good is a variable you can't change?<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<i>Run</i> couldn't tell you, because you CAN change variables, integers at least! There are 5 change commands in <i>Run</i>:
<pre><code>	+=	[name]	[value]
	-=	[name]	[value]
	*=	[name]	[value]
	/=	[name]	[value]
	%=	[name]	[value]</code></pre>
&nbsp;The first four will respectively add, subtract, multiply, and divide the value of <code>[name]</code> by <code>[value]</code>, and store the result back in <code>[name]</code>. The fifth one will set name to the remainder of <code>[name]</code> divided by <code>[value]</code> (modulus division). Here's an example:
<pre><code>	create	y	1
	+=	y	1
	*=	y	9
	%=	y	4
	-=	y	10
	/=	y	-8</code></pre>
&nbsp;This will create a variable <code>y</code> equal to <code>1</code>, add <code>1</code> to it to give it a value of <code>2</code>, multiply it by <code>9</code> to give it a value of <code>18</code>, modulo-divide it by <code>4</code> to give it a value of <code>2</code>, subtract <code>10</code> to set it to <code>-8</code>, and divide it by <code>-8</code> to set it back to <code>1</code>. All operators work like most programming languages with 32-bit integers: division will result in an integer rounded down, overflows will make the number go crazy.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Run also includes some useful special system variables! The variables
<pre><code>	.mousex
	.mousey</code></pre>
represent the mouse's current x- and y-coordinates. So for example,
<pre><code>	create	int	clickx	.mousex
	create	int	clicky	.mousey</code></pre>
would create two variables, each with a mouse coordinate. If the mouse was at x-<code>145</code>, y-<code>234</code>, <code>clickx</code> would have a value of <code>145</code> and <code>clicky</code> would have a value of <code>234</code>.<br>
&nbsp;Similarly, you can use
<pre><code>	.screenwidth
	.screenheight</code></pre>
to get the current screen display's width and height.<br>
&nbsp;There is also a system variable
<pre><code>	.skipped</code></pre>
that you can use after using a pause or pausenot with a millisecond count at the end. This variable indicates that the pause exited before the color was correct. For example, if you had
<pre><code>	pause	100	100	255	255	255	1000</code></pre>
and a second went by without seeing white, <code>.skipped</code> would be set to <code>true</code>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now we have autoclicking and variables. What more could we possibly want?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>================================================================<br>
SECTION 3- Programming Language Features- Conditionals and Loops<br>
================================================================</h3>
&nbsp;Yep, conditionals and for loops, that's what!<br>
&nbsp;Earlier, it was mentioned that you could create variables of type <code>boolean</code>. The main use of these is for the <code>if</code> commands that look like this:
<pre><code>	if	[boolean]
		[command1]
	[command2]</code></pre>
&nbsp;The way this works is that if <code>[boolean]</code> is <code>true</code>, both <code>[command1]</code> and <code>[command2]</code> get called. If <code>[boolean]</code> is <code>false</code>, <code>[command1]</code> doesn't get called, but <code>[command2]</code> does.<br>
&nbsp;In addition to this format, <code>if</code> has another syntax that can be used, and it looks like this:
<pre><code>	if	[boolean]
	[
		[command1]
		[command2]
		...
	]
	[some-other-commands]</code></pre>
&nbsp;Right after the <code>if</code> command, a line with a <code>[</code> bracket at the beginning signifies the start of the commands to be run conditionally. If <code>[boolean]</code> is <code>false</code>, the pointer jumps to the <code>]</code> bracket and continues. You can also use <code>(</code> parentheses and <code>{</code> braces, or mix and match them, and they will all work the same.<br>
&nbsp;Now, <code>if</code> commands are very line-sensitive, so make sure your line formats are correct. Take this for example:
<pre><code>	create	boolean	test	[value]
	if	test
		:here
		[command]</code></pre>
&nbsp;Since <code>if</code> only skips the next line, the label will get skipped instead of <code>[command]</code>. So whether <code>[value]</code> is <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, <code>[command]</code> will get executed anyways. Brackets are also sensitive: a bracket must appear immediately after the <code>if</code> command, or it won't get recognized- the following,
<pre><code>	if	false
	:here
	[
		[command]
		...
	]</code></pre>
will execute <code>[command]</code> since the brackets are not linked to the <code>if</code> command. In addition, all brackets link to each other, so make sure they're all paired correctly.<br>
&nbsp;So now that we have our <code>if</code> command, we can use it with jumps for more complex conditionals:
<pre><code>	create	boolean	sety	true
	create	int	x	100
	create	int	y	100
	if	sety
		jump	thisisalabel
	set	x	150
	jump	end
	:thisisalabel
	set	y	150
	:end</code></pre>
&nbsp;This will set <code>y</code> to <code>150</code> since the value given to it is <code>true</code>. If the <code>true</code> were replaced with <code>false</code>, <code>x</code> would get set to <code>150</code>. The above is also equivalent to the following:
<pre><code>	create	boolean	sety	true
	create	int	x	100
	create	int	y	100
	if	sety
	[
		set	y	150
		jump	end
	]
	set	x	150
	:end</code></pre>
&nbsp;Constant and variable booleans are not the only booleans that can be put in an <code>if</code> clause. In fact, <code>if</code> commands are not the only places that these clauses can be used! These clauses are big enough that they get their own section, and we haven't even gotten to <code>for</code> loops!<br>
<br>
<h4>================================================================<br>
SECTION 3.1- Clauses<br>
================================================================</h4>
&nbsp;A clause is a big paramater consisting of a bunch of operators and variables. The commands <code>create</code>, <code>set</code>, <code>setargto</code>, and <code>if</code> all have access to these special clauses, although <code>create</code>, <code>set</code>, and <code>setargto</code> only have access when storing to an <code>int</code> or <code>boolean</code>. The <code>at</code> paramater used in colors is unavailable in clauses.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Let's go over how the variable types are stored and represented in clauses. A clause stores all types as integers. All variable types (except colors) have an integer representation.<br>
- <code>int</code>s are stored as 32-bit numbers and are simply represented as themselves.<br>
- <code>boolean</code>s are stored as <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. They represent <code>1</code> if they are <code>true</code>, and <code>0</code> if they are <code>false</code>. Now, in addition to a <code>boolean</code> being treated as a number, numbers can be used as booleans. When a result in a clause gets interpreted as a <code>boolean</code>, any number besides <code>0</code> is interpreted as <code>true</code> (<code>0</code> is <code>false</code>). For the most part, you won't be using <code>boolean</code> variables as integers.<br>
- <code>color</code>s are stored as 3 different integer values. A <code>color</code> does not have a single integer representation- rather, they are converted into three integers, one for each of their red, green, and blue components. Colors should generally only be used with special color clauses.<br>
- <code>timer</code>s are stored similarly to <code>int</code>s, and for the most part are treated as integers. The difference is that <code>timer</code>s change over time, and can only receive single values when creating or setting, rather than a clause.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;A clause always returns an <code>int</code>, but can be interpreted as a <code>boolean</code> when storing to a <code>boolean</code> variable or as the result of an <code>if</code> condition.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;So now that we've gotten that over with, let's go over the clauses! They can be used in the following format:
<pre><code>	if	[clause]
	create	[type]	[name]	[clause]
	set	[name]	[clause]
	setargto	[prefix]	[name]</code></pre>
&nbsp;Note that for <code>setargto</code>, the clause has to be a paramater to the program, separated with commas rather than spaces. There'll be a bit on that a little later.<br>
&nbsp;Clauses can be as simple or complicated as you make them. Take a look at this:
<pre><code>	if	true</code></pre>
&nbsp;This will always pass, as the clause represents <code>true</code>, and nothing else. Here's another clause that does the same thing:
<pre><code>	create	boolean	test	true
	if	test</code></pre>
&nbsp;The clause is <code>true</code> if the <code>boolean</code> is <code>true</code>. Here's a third way to do the same thing:
<pre><code>	if	23</pre></code>
&nbsp;Since numbers can be treated as booleans, any number besides <code>0</code> represents <code>true</code>.<br>
&nbsp;Here is another clause form:
<pre><code>	if	input	[arg]</code></pre>
&nbsp;This evaluates to <code>true</code> if <code>[arg]</code> was given as an argument to the program. For instance, starting a script with
<pre><code>	java run thisisascript hello</code></pre>
would make <code>hello</code> be an argument. These <code>if</code>s,
<pre><code>	if	input	goodbye
	if	input	hello
	if	input	he
	if	input	helloo</code></pre>
would evaluate to <code>false</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, and <code>false</code> respectively.<br>
&nbsp;There are four integer-value evaluation clauses:
<pre><code>	if	>=	[value1]	[value2]
	if	>	[value1]	[value2]
	if	<=	[value1]	[value2]
	if	<	[value1]	[value2]</code></pre>
&nbsp;These are pretty straight-forward, they evaluate to <code>true</code> if <code>[value1]</code> is greater-than-or-equal-to, greater than, less-than-or-equal-to, or less than <code>[value2]</code>, respectively. Remember that <code>boolean</code>s are represented as a <code>1</code> or a <code>0</code>, so you can use them like integers here; <code>color</code>s can also be used like integers, but those are a bit trickier. There is an equals, but we'll get to that later.<br>
&nbsp;There are two clause forms that deal with pixel colors. The first one,
<pre><code>	if	colorat	[x]	[y]	[r]	[g]	[b]</code></pre>
evaluates to <code>true</code> if the pixel at x-<code>[x]</code>, y-<code>[y]</code> is r-<code>[r]</code>, g-<code>[g]</code>, b-<code>[b]</code>. It also has a format
<pre><code>	if	colorat	[x]	[y]	[color]</code></pre>
which uses the <code>color</code> variables, just like <code>pause</code>s. The second form,
<pre><code>	if	scan	[x]	[y]	[w]	[h]	[r]	[g]	[b]</code></pre>
takes a screenshot of the rectangle with top-left corner at x-<code>[x]</code>, y-<code>[y]</code>, with width <code>[w]</code> and height <code>[h]</code>. If any of the pixels in that rectangle are r-<code>[r]</code>, g-<code>[g]</code>, b-<code>[b]</code>, then it returns <code>true</code>. A single <code>scan</code> runs about as fast as a single <code>colorat</code> search. Like <code>colorat</code>s, <code>scan</code> also has the form
<pre><code>	if	scan	[x]	[y]	[w]	[h]	[color]</code></pre>
which uses the <code>color</code> variables. Scanning also introduces two new system variables,
<pre><code>	.scanx
	.scany</code></pre>
which are the x- and y-coordinates of the pixel that triggered the scan to be <code>true</code>. If the scan returns <code>false</code>, they are both <code>-1</code>.<br>
&nbsp;So now that there are some basic clauses, <i>Run</i> also supports standard boolean logic with the following five commands:
<pre><code>	if	not	[clause]
	if	or	[clause1]	[clause2]
	if	and	[clause1]	[clause2]
	if	==	[clause1]	[clause2]
	if	!=	[clause1]	[clause2]</code></pre>
&nbsp;Let's go over how these work. The <code>not</code> clause,
<pre><code>	if	not	[clause]</code></pre>
will evaluate to <code>false</code> if <code>[clause]</code> IS <code>true</code>. For example,
<pre><code>	create	int	five	4
	create	boolean	GoodValue	false
	if	not	GoodValue
		set	five	5</code></pre>
will end up setting the value of <code>five</code> to <code>5</code>, since <code>GoodValue</code> is NOT <code>true</code>. The <code>or</code> clause,
<pre><code>	if	or	[clause1]	[clause2]</code></pre>
will end up evaluating to <code>true</code> if <code>[clause1]</code> is <code>true</code>, <code>[clause2]</code> is <code>true</code>, or both are. Say you wanted to run a command if either of two <code>boolean</code>s were <code>true</code>:
<pre><code>	create	boolean	a	true
	create	boolean	b	true
	if	or	a	b
		move	100	100</code></pre>
&nbsp;If either <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> is <code>true</code>, the mouse will move to x-<code>100</code>, y-<code>100</code>. Similarly, the <code>and</code> clause,
<pre><code>	if	and	[clause1]	[clause2]</code></pre>
will evaluate to <code>true</code> only if both <code>[clause1]</code> and <code>[clause2]</code> are true. The last two clauses,
<pre><code>	if	==	[var1]	[var2]
	if	!=	[var1]	[var2]</code></pre>
will evaluate to <code>true</code> if <code>[var1]</code> is equal or not equal to <code>[var2]</code>, respectively. The variables are equal to each other if their integer representations are equal. So if you had the following,
<pre><code>	create	int	a	123
	create	int	b	123
	if	==	a	b
		move	100	100</code></pre>
then the mouse would move since <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are equal.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;In addition to having your results evaluate to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> (<code>1</code> or <code>0</code>), there are also a few arithmetic operators that produce standard integers:
<pre><code>	set	var	+	[val1]	[val2]
	set	var	-	[val1]	[val2]
	set	var	*	[val1]	[val2]
	set	var	/	[val1]	[val2]
	set	var	%	[val1]	[val2]
	set	var	random	[val1]</code></pre>
&nbsp;The 5 change commands for integers are available here as operators. In this first example,
<pre><code>	set	var	+	[val1]	[val2]</code></pre>
the variable called var would be given a value equal to the addition of <code>[val1]</code> and <code>[val2]</code>; the following,
<pre><code>	create	int	var	3
	set	var	+	2	3</code></pre>
would create <code>var</code> as <code>3</code>, and then set it to <code>5</code>. If you then had a command,
<pre><code>	set	var	+	var	2</code></pre>
this var would be set to <code>7</code>, which is equivalent to
<pre><code>	+=	var	2</code></pre>
&nbsp;All of the first five symbols act equivalently to their change-command counterpart, in the same manner that addition was shown above.<br>
&nbsp;In this example,
<pre><code>	set	var	random	[val1]</code></pre>
<code>var</code> gets set to a random value. Using <code>random</code> will assign the variable to a number ranging from <code>0</code> to the argument that follows, minus <code>1</code>. So in this example,
<pre><code>	set	var	random	30</code></pre>
<code>var</code> would be assigned a number from <code>0</code> to <code>29</code> inclusive.<br>
&nbsp;There are also three operators that allow you to use the values of color variables:
<pre><code>	create	color	orange	255	192	0
	create	int	fullred	1
	create	int	mostlygreen	1
	create	int	noblue	1
	set	fullred	redpart	orange
	set	mostlygreen	greenpart	orange
	set	noblue	bluepart	orange</code></pre>
&nbsp;The <code>fullred</code> variable would be <code>255</code>, <code>mostlygreen</code> would be <code>192</code>, and <code>noblue</code> would be <code>0</code>.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;So now that we have boolean logic and arithmetic, let's combine them to form more complex expressions! Say you created these variables,
<pre><code>	create	boolean	A	true
	create	boolean	B	false
	create	int	C	1
	create	int	D	7</code></pre>
and then you wanted to implement this expression:
<pre><code>	(A and B or (C + 6 != D / 3))</code></pre>
&nbsp;In order to use this as a clause, it has to be formatted properly. First make sure all operators are grouped with only two values:
<pre><code>	((A and B) or ((C + 6) != (D / 3)))</code></pre>
&nbsp;Next, move all operators to the left side of the parentheses, since this is the format for operators:
<pre><code>	(or (and A B) (!= (+ C 6) (/ D 3)))</code></pre>
&nbsp;After removing the parentheses, we can put it in a clause:
<pre><code>	if	or	and	A	B	!=	+	C	6	/	D	3</code></pre>
&nbsp;As soon as this line gets reached, <i>Run</i> starts evaluating. How this works is that the pointer starts from the right, and goes left along the expression, evaluating the operators as it goes. The variables are given their values. As soon as the pointer reaches an operator, it uses it in conjunction with the values that follow it. For instance, the pointer in this example starts at the <code>3</code>, goes to the <code>D</code> and stores it as <code>6</code>, and when it reaches the <code>/</code>, it stores the value of <code>D / 3</code>. Take a look at the sequence of evaluation steps that take place:
<pre><code>												V
	if	or	and	A	B	!=	+	C	6	/	D	3
	
											V
	if	or	and	A	B	!=	+	C	6	/	7	3
	
										V
	if	or	and	A	B	!=	+	C	6	2
	
									V
	if	or	and	A	B	!=	+	C	6	2
	
								V
	if	or	and	A	B	!=	+	1	6	2
	
							V
	if	or	and	A	B	!=	7			2
	
						V
	if	or	and	A	B	true
	
					V
	if	or	and	A	false	true
	
				V
	if	or	and	true	false	true
	
			V
	if	or	false			true
	
		V
	if	true</code></pre>
&nbsp;At the end, the result is true, so the <code>if</code> does not skip lines. And that's how clauses work!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;One last thing before we finish clauses, let's take a look at the way <code>create</code>, <code>set</code>, and <code>setgargto</code> all work. The create command uses clauses when creating <code>int</code>s and <code>boolean</code>s. So you could assign a <code>boolean</code> or <code>int</code> like this:
<pre><code>	create	int	twelve	*	2	-	D	C
	create	boolean	falsity	==	A	B</code></pre>
&nbsp;<code>set</code> takes the same form:
<pre><code>	set	twelve	+	+	D	C	4
	set	falsity	and	A	B</code></pre>
&nbsp;For <code>setargto</code>, the clause has to take place on the command line. So take a look at this line:
<pre><code>	set	twelve	-	*	7	2	2</code></pre>
&nbsp;To have <code>setargto</code> perform the same action, have something this line in your script:
<pre><code>	setargto	t	twelve</code></pre>
&nbsp;Then, when you run your script, type
<pre><code>	java myscript t-,*,7,2,2</code></pre>
and the <code>setargto</code> command will perform just like the <code>set</code> command. Note that you cannot access variables from a <code>setargto</code>- variable access is limited to the script that the variables exist in, so something like this,
<pre><code>	java myscript t-,*,D,2,2</code></pre>
would not have the <code>D</code> turn into <code>7</code>, even though there is a variable of name <code>D</code>.<br>
<br>
<h4>================================================================<br>
SECTION 3.2- For Loops<br>
================================================================</h4>
&nbsp;Now on to for loops! They don't really need their own section, but hey, why not? A <code>for</code> loop has this form:
<pre><code>	for	[name]	[init]	[max]	[incr]</code></pre>
and ends with the command
<pre><code>	end</code></pre>
&nbsp;The for loop generates a variable named <code>[name]</code> with a value of <code>[init]</code>. When the code reaches the <code>end</code> command, it increases <code>[name]</code> by <code>[incr]</code>. If the variable is greater than <code>[max]</code> (when <code>[incr]</code> is positive or <code>0</code>) or less than <code>[max]</code> (when <code>[incr]</code> is negative), the pointer jumps to the line after the <code>end</code> command; otherwise, it jumps back to the top. As for the variables defined by the <code>for</code> command, they take on the following properties:<br>
- The variables defined by the <code>for</code> loop are available to all commands.<br>
- If there is a global variable outside the <code>for</code> loop with the same name as that variable, the <code>for</code> loop one will get picked if it gets referenced.<br>
- Variables only exist while the <code>for</code> loop is in effect: once the <code>for</code> loop ends, the variables are no longer available (unless they were created earlier).<br>
- Nested <code>for</code> loops have access to all variables from the previous <code>for</code> loops.<br>
- Variables created with <code>create</code> commands within the loop are global, and will not disappear.<br>
- <code>jump</code> and <code>call</code> commands can access labels outside of the for loop, but you should make sure you return to where it was called. Each <code>end</code> command is paired to a specific <code>for</code> command. If you have nested <code>for</code> loops and the pointer reaches the wrong <code>end</code> command because of jumping, the loops may function incorrectly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Here is an example of <code>two</code> for loops that do the same thing:
<pre><code>	for	x	100	200	10
		left	x	100
		pause	1000
	end
	
	create	int	total	0
	for	x	0	-100	-10
		set	total	-	100	x
		left	total	100
		pause	1000
	end</code></pre>
&nbsp;These will left click at x-<code>100</code>, y-<code>100</code>, pause a second, left click at x-<code>110</code>, y-<code>100</code>, pause a second, and so on. At the end, they will click at x-<code>200</code>, y-<code>100</code>, pause a second, and then continue on.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Paired with <code>for</code> loops is the ability to exit them early. This is done with 3 breaking commands of varying power:
<pre><code>	break
	return
	quit</code></pre>
&nbsp;<code>break</code> will exit out of the current loop (it must be within a loop). <code>return</code> will exit out of the current script, but the program will keep running if another script called it. <code>quit</code> will stop all autoclicking and end the program.<br>
&nbsp;You might have noticed that there is no while loop, this is because the same effect can be acheived with either of the following patterns:
<pre><code>	:label1
	if	not	[condition to keep it running]
		jump label2
	[some commands]
	jump	label1
	:label2
	
	:label1
	if	[condition to keep it running]
	[
		[some commands]
		jump	label1
	]</code></pre>
&nbsp;This gives loops more versatility when running.<br>
<br>
================================================================<br>
SECTION 4- Miscellaneous Features<br>
================================================================<br>
<br>
&nbsp;In addition to clicking, run also allows you to type. There are three commands for key presses:
<pre><code>	type	.[text]
	press	[button]
	release	[button]</code></pre>
&nbsp;<code>type</code> will type any remaining characters on the line after the period- tabs, spaces, uppercase and lowercase letters, and any other keyboard characters. This special syntax means that any other characters before the period will be ignored (including whitespace), and that if you have no characters after the period, <code>type</code> will type nothing.<br>
&nbsp;<code>press</code> will press down one of the following buttons when substituting <code>[button]</code>:
<pre><code>	enter
	backspace
	delete
	control
	up
	down
	left
	right
	shift
	alt
	capslock
	escape
	tab
	space
	home
	end
	pageup
	pagedown</code></pre>
&nbsp;<code>release</code> will release the key. You can also press/release any of the single characters that you can use in the type command, other than tab or space (tab and space are included in the list since they are normally whitespace).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;There are also some miscellaneous options that can be set with these commands:
<pre><code>	optionon	[setting]
	optionoff	[setting]</code></pre>
&nbsp;This will either turn on or turn off, respectively, certain settings that can be helpful while running scripts. All settings apply only to the script that called it. <code>optionon</code> settings may take extra arguments, but <code>optionoff</code> only needs the name of the option. There are currently seven available settings.<br>
&nbsp;The first one,
<pre><code>	optionon	quitafter	[number]</code></pre>
takes an integer argument, <code>[number]</code>. Since <code>pause</code>s and <code>pausenot</code>s only continue once the pixel changes, the script might run indefinitely if the pixel doesn't change properly. This option will end the script if <code>[number]</code> milliseconds pass without the pixel changing. Note that this is different than an extra argument at the end of the pause/pausenot, because that argument will continue running the script. <code>quitafter</code> is off by default.<br>
&nbsp;The second option,
<pre><code>	optionon	endingcall	[label]</code></pre>
triggers when the script ends in the middle (abnormally), which happens when the mouse is moved, a <code>quit</code> command is called, or a <code>pause</code> reaches its <code>quitafter</code> point. <code>endingcall</code> jumps to the label <code>[label]</code>, and turns off the <code>endingcall</code> option. It can be reenabled if there is another <code>optionon endingcall</code> command after the label. <code>endingcall</code> is not called for scripts that end normally (by reaching the bottom of the script). If a script ends abnormally, then any scripts that called it will end abnormally as well, triggering those scripts' <code>endingcall</code>s if they were set. <code>endingcall</code> is off by default.<br>
&nbsp;The third option,
<pre><code>	optionon	variance	[red]	[green]	[blue]</code></pre>
is for use with checking pixel colors. The <code>variance</code> is how much higher or lower each of the three color values (red, green, blue) can be to be accepted as correct. If a value of the <code>variance</code> is <code>5</code>, then in any command that uses pixel colors, an acceptable pixel value can be between <code>5</code> higher and <code>5</code> lower than the given value. If the red variance is 5, checking for a red of <code>128</code> would accept anything from <code>123</code> to <code>133</code> as the right color value. You can also use
<pre><code>	optionon	variance	[value]</code></pre>
to set <code>[value]</code> to all three color variances. <code>variance</code> is <code>5 5 5</code> by default. Turning off the <code>variance</code> sets it to <code>0 0 0</code>. Setting a negative <code>variance</code> is a bad idea.<br>
&nbsp;The fourth option,
<pre><code>	optionon	mousetolerance	[xtolerance]	[ytolerance]</code></pre>
allows you to adjust the primary way of ending a script early (abnormally), which is by moving the mouse during a pause. Setting the tolerance will set how much distance the mouse can move during a pause. When a pause command executes, it records the mouse position at the beginning. If the mouse moves too far away from that spot, the script will end (abnormally). If the tolerance were <code>0 0</code>, then any mouse movement would trigger an abnormal ending. If the tolerance were <code>5 10</code> and the mouse started at x-<code>115</code>, y-<code>130</code>, then the mouse could move anywhere in the rectangle within x-<code>110-120</code> and y-<code>120-140</code> without triggering an abnormal ending. Like <code>variance</code>, you can also use
<pre><code>	optionon	mousetolerance	[tolerance]</code></pre>
to set <code>[tolerance]</code> to both the x and y tolerance. <code>mousetolerance</code> is <code>0 0</code> by default. Turning off <code>mousetolerance</code> sets it to this default. Setting a negative <code>mousetolerance</code> is a bad idea.<br>
&nbsp;The fifth option,
<pre><code>	optionon	scanorder	[direction]	[direction]</code></pre>
sets the order in which the <code>scan</code> clause runs. The first direction is the primary direction in which the <code>scan</code> searches the picture, the second direction is the secondary direction. The directions for the command are <code>up</code>, <code>down</code>, <code>left</code>, and <code>right</code>. If you had the following, 
<pre><code>	optionon	scanorder	right	up</code></pre>
then <code>scan</code>s would start at the bottom left corner, go right along the row, and once the end has been reached, it would move up a row, go the left side, and start again. If your first direction is invalid (not <code>up</code>, <code>down</code>, <code>left</code>, or <code>right</code>), the <code>scanorder</code> does not get set. If your second direction is invalid, or is on the same axis as the first direction (vertical or horizontal), a default second direction will be assigned: <code>down</code> for vertical and <code>right</code> for horizontal. The default <code>scanorder</code> is <code>right</code> then <code>down</code>. Turning off <code>scanorder</code> sets it to this default.<br>
&nbsp;The sixth option,
<pre><code>	optionon	offset	[x]	[y]</code></pre>
allows you to set an offset to apply to all interactions with the screen. Any action that uses screen coordinates (<code>move</code>, <code>pausenot</code>, <code>scan</code>, etc.) will shift by this amount, essentially setting the screen so that this new location is the top left corner. For example, if you had a script with the following commands,
<pre><code>	optionon	offset	50	100
	move	25	37</code></pre>
the mouse would move to x-<code>75</code>, y-<code>137</code>. Similarly,
<pre><code>	optionon	offset	2	43
	pause	10	10	255	255	255</code></pre>
would wait until the color at x-<code>12</code>, y-<code>53</code> is the right color. All variables are unaffected, and .<code>scanx</code>, <code>.scany</code>, <code>.mousex</code>, and <code>.mousey</code> take the offset into account. If you had
<pre><code>	optionon	offset	34	56
	if	scan	10	10	20	20	30	30	30
		[command]</code></pre>
the scan would start at x-<code>44</code>, y-<code>66</code>. If the pixel at x-<code>44</code>, y-<code>66</code> is the correct color, then <code>.scanx</code> would be <code>10</code> and <code>.scany</code> would be <code>10</code>. If you then had
<pre><code>	move	.scanx	.scany</code></pre>
your mouse would move to x-<code>44</code>, y-<code>66</code>. Similarly, for <code>.mousex</code> and <code>.mousey</code>, if you had
<pre><code>	optionon	offset	12	33
	create	int	mx	.mousex
	create	int	my	.mousey
	move	mx	my
	
	move	.mousex	.mousey</code></pre>
and your mouse was at x-<code>125</code>, y-<code>150</code>then mx and my would be the <code>113</code> and <code>117</code>, respectively, and the mouse would effectively not move. The second part would do the same thing, moving the mouse nowhere. <code>offset</code> is off by default.<br>
&nbsp;The seventh option,
<pre><code>	optionon	endmessages</code></pre>
sets whether or not <i>Run</i> will display a descriptive ending message when the program exits abnormally. <code>endmessages</code> is on by default.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;One last feature, you can print to the command line almost just like you can in Java. The command
<pre><code>	print	.[text]</code></pre>
will print, to the console/terminal, everything after the period in the same format as type,
<pre><code>	printval	[name]</code></pre>
will print out the value of the variable named <code>[name]</code>, and
<pre><code>	println</code></pre>
will start a new line. <code>println</code> can also accept text as an argument just like <code>print</code>, printing the text out and starting a new line.<br>
&nbsp;<code>printval</code> can also print out any of the system variables, plus a special system variable,
<pre><code>	printval	.timestamp</code></pre>
that will print the time & date, rather than a variable's value. The timestamp format is a 24-hour clock displayed <code>HH:MM:SS DD/MM/YYYY</code>.<br>
&nbsp;Here's an example:
<pre><code>	create	int	test	123
	print	.The value of "test" is 
	printval	test
	print	. at
	printval	.timestamp
	print	..
	println
	println	.Also, here's a tab:	.</code></pre>
&nbsp;This would print out these two lines:
<pre><code>The value of "test" is 123 at 0:00:00 1/1/1970.
Also, here's a tab:	.</code></pre>
&nbsp;The time here would be replaced with the real time, rather than the epoch.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;And that's that! You now know how to create autoclicker scripts! The autoclicker will also automatically do a quick syntax check of all scripts to be run (though it won't necessarily catch everything) to make sure that certain errors don't appear. All comments get removed upon running the script, as if they were never there (take this into account with your if commands).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<i>Run</i> is a growing program, there are always plenty of things that can be added or changed. Feel free to send an e-mail to gregory.loden@gmail.com with suggestions, misspellings, confusions, or bug reports.<br>
